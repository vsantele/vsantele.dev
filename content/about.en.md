Allow me to introduce myself, Victor Santelé, 24 years old, graduate student at Henallux in Computer Science bachelor with a specialization in Data Science.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science at UNamur.

In the future, I aspire to work in the field of Data Science, specifically as a Data Engineer.

Outside of computer science, I am passionate about beer. I love discovering new beers, exploring different styles, and even brewing my own.

I have been playing table tennis for about ten years at RCTT Kitch in Mouscron, and when I have spare time, I enjoy cycling, both mountain biking and road cycling.

I have a strong passion for learning and discovering new things, both in the field of computer science and in general.
